# Quiz COVID19

Project of a quiz created for the COVID-19 Global Hackathon 1.0

## Inspiration

Many people like to play quiz games on Facebook, so I thought of creating an educational quiz about the virus. Thus, people can learn and have fun at the same time.

## What it does

Quiz COVID19 is a game of questions and answers about the Virus. The player when participating in the game, learns about the virus and can also share the quiz for other people to play. In addition, the player can continue playing until he gets all the questions right.

## How we built it

I made a spreadsheet with Google Sheets and published an API with Google Script. After that, I created an interface with Flutter for mobile and finally, added support for Portuguese and English.

## Challenges I ran into

It was hard to think of something original, so I decided to create a quiz to help verify people's knowledge about the virus.

## What I learned

Mixing between the vision of the user and the vision of an IT expert

## What's next for Quiz COVID19?

*   Support for more languages;
*   Add more questions;
*   Creating a ranking;
*   Map the average of hits by cities.
